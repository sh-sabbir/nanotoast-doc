# Specific Rules to Prevent Full Rewrites
- Restrict AI from rewriting components entirely when modifying directory structure.
- Focus only on updating import paths and file references when changing folder hierarchy.
- Maintain the existing structure and logic of components during such changes.

# Folder Structure Modifications
- Use lowercase with dashes for new directories and maintain this style (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Organize by feature rather than type (e.g., group related components, hooks, styles).
- Keep each module's structure intact, just updating directory paths to reflect the new structure.

# General Conventions
- Prefer named exports for components to ensure easy refactoring.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for components and props to maintain type safety.
- All path changes should use aliases where possible to minimize the need for component updates.
